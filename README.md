# left-exclusive-join-sql-pandas
It concerns the left exclusive join of two tables without primary keys via sql or pandas

# Project motivation
* Assume we have two tables, t1 and t2. They all have features, like 'account, name, date, code, type, amount'. However, there is not primary key to distinguish them. 
* How can we select the data which is in t1 but not in t2?
* To address this issue, I have figured out solutions with sql or pandas separately

## [SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/set-operators-except-and-intersect-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)

## [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
